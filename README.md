This is basic understanding how node js is diffrent from Hono, Where you are writing your code so you can deploy you backend to serverless server (cloudeFlare workes)

create .env file in root dir
```
DATABASE_URL
```

the the databaseurl is your cloude postegrasSQL provider 

and create wrangler.toml file in root dir
which is created automaticly after installing the hono
and the key are 
```
DATABASE_URL:
JWT_SECRET:
```
in wrangler.toml the databaseURL are created from your prisma accelator 
so your request first hit pool then backend

then, You can run prisma commands to set the prisma like ,
```
npx prisma init
```
and for visulation 
```
npx prisma studio
```

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

```
npm run deploy
```
